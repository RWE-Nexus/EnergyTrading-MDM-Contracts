EnergyTrading.MDM.Contracts
===========================

XML compliant dto / contract definitions, interfaces and base classes that the EnergyTrading.MDM service consumes.

The MDM entity service endpoints expect their entities to derive from the IMdmEntity class defined in this package.

The core MDM solution includes support for the SourceSystem entity whose contract is defined within this package.
Similarly, the ReferenceData type is also defined here, whilst not a fully-fledged MDM entity, it a generic look-up data concept.
